Prototyping calorimeter clustering algorithms for E989, the Muon g-2 experiment
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This code has a few pieces.

## Signal generation

Generate simulated calorimeter signals. Save both the generated waveforms
and the truth information.

## Testing

Run an algorithm on some generated signals and test its performance

## Clustering

The actual algorithms that do the clustering
